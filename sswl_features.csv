They are complex, and allow a prepositional option (navzdory větru `in_spite_of wind' would be fine as well in the example).

A single word is always fine (i.e., John yes, but John Smith no), but a compound is ok too. The restriction on prenominal possessors thus has to make reference to ""word-hood"" in some sense.

Gloss: {neg} Petr {neg}-publish.3sg {neg} articles {neg} Translation: Peter doesn't publish articles. Comment: The example shows that in the SOV order, the negation comes between the subject and the verb (and only there). One reason to classify it as a prefix (as opposed to a particle) is that it obligatorily moves with the verb (the host of the prefix): Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: Petr {*ne} články {ne}-píše Gloss: Petr neg articles neg-writes Translation: Petr doesn't write articles. Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: A: Píše Petr články? B: Ne Gloss: A: writes Petr articles? B: Neg Translation: A: Does Peter write articles? B: No Comment: However, this example shows that a morpheme homophonous to the negative prefix ""ne"" can occur on its own in short replies. This is impossible for aspectual verbal prefixes (and is an unexpected behavior of an affix in general, or at least according to the definition given.) Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: br-á-t či ne-br-a-t? (*ne-br-á-t) Gloss: take-th-inf or neg-take-th-inf vs. neg-take-th-inf Translation: to take or not to take? Comment: This example shows that the negation has an influence on the length of the thematic vowel (glossed TH): long vowel (á) without the negation, short vowel (a) with the negation. This speaks in favor of its prefixal status. This is because the thematic vowel ""a"" is ""regularly"" short, and lengthens only with roots that have no vowel (plausibly to produce a bi-moraic ""minimal word""). The fact that the ""a"" is short in the negated infinitive shows that the negation counts as a part of the ""prosodic word.""

Gloss: see.2sg dem towel white Translation: Can you see that white towel (over there)? Comment: However, as noted above, in some special context Czech allows N>A orders (see the N>A parameter).

Gloss: dem four ships had_to from port sail_away Translation: The four ships had to leave the harbour. Comment: For reasons related to the property Num-Dem-N, let me mention that the example is fine in the following context: suppose four ships arrive to a harbour, but find all the docking places occupied. So, ""the four ships had to leave the harbour."" (This rules out partitive interpretation.) Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: Co si myslíš o těchhle čtyrech knížkách?

Gloss: four dem ships had_to from harbour sail_away Translation: The four ships had to leave the harbour. Comment: The sentence is judged in a context where four ships arrived at a harbour, but found all docking places occupied. So ""the four ships had to leave the harbour."" Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: Čtyry ty lodě musely z přístavu odplout. Gloss: four the ships had_to from harbour leave. Translation: Four of the ships had to leave the harbour. Comment: The same word order as in the preceding example is grammatical in a context where five ships arrive at a harbour. Finding all but one docking place occupied, ""four of the ships had to leave the harbour."" Conclusion: Num-Dem-N is fine with partitive reading. Contributor: Pavel Caha Order N3 12_Numeral Noun Demonstrative No Pavel Caha + Q01_Initial polar Q-marker No Pavel Caha Words: Jí Petr polívku? Gloss: eats Peter soup Translation: Does Peter eat soup? / Is Peter eating the soup? Comment: Compare this to the declarative example sentence in 05_Subject verb object. Set against the declarative sentence, the example shows that Czech yes/no questions put the verb to the left of the subject. There is no additional morpheme on the left periphery, Contributor: Pavel Caha + Q02_Final polar Q-marker No Pavel Caha Words: Jí Petr polívku? Gloss: eats Peter soup? Translation: Does Peter eat soup? Is Peter eating the soup? Comment: The sentence has a raising intonation at the end. Since such marking does not count as a bound morpheme, the answer to the parameter is NO. Contributor: Pavel Caha Q03_Clause internal polar Q-marker No Pavel Caha + Q04_Polar question by intonation No Pavel Caha Words: Petr jí polívku? Gloss: Peter eats soup Translation: Peter eats soup? Comment: In comparison to the declarative in 05_svo, this sentence has a raising intonation at the end (typical for Cz questions). However, it does not front the verb (compare the example in Q_01). The meaning is dependent on further factors. If the main stress falls on ""soup"", and the raising intonation starts there, the meaning is surprise. With stress on the verb, one meaning is: does he eat it or drink it? Another one: does also Peter eat soup? Value set to NO, as these are not ""neutral."" Contributor: Pavel Caha + Q05_Polar question by V-fronting Yes Pavel Caha Words: Píše Petr dopis? Gloss: writes peter letter Translation: Is Peter writing the letter?

Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: Bude Petr psát dopis? Gloss: will Peter write.inf letter Translation: Will Peter write the letter? Is Peter going to write the letter? Comment: Set against the first example, the sentence shows that only the aux moves. However, note that this is specific to the future aux `will.' Past tense aux is distinct: Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: Vy jste psali dopis Gloss: you.pl aux=be.2.pl written letter Translation: You were writing the latter Comment: a base line for the next ex: Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: *jste vy psali dopis? Gloss: are you.pl written letter? Translation: Were we writing the letter Comment: shows that the past aux cannot front. (probably related to the fact that the past aux is a 2nd position clitic, the future one not).

Contributor: Pavel Caha + Q11_Affirmative answer by auxiliary and verb No Pavel Caha Words: Bude Petr jíst polívku? -- Bude (*jíst) Gloss: will peter eat.inf soup -- will eat.inf Translation: Will Peter have some soup? Yes Comment: The example shows that the main verb cannot be included in the answer, although the aux alone can. there is perhaps an exception to the property value, see below Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: Jedl jsem tu polívku už někdy? -- jedl-(s) / *jedl jsi Gloss: ate am that soup already sometime -- ate-are / ate are Translation: Have I ever eaten that soup before -- yes, you have Comment: The Czech past auxiliaries are 2nd position clitics. Each seems to have slightly different properties (e.g. 1st sg can be left out when the subject is overt, 2sg cannot). The 2sg aux can be reduced to a single consonant, other auxiliaries cannot. (Even when reduced, it is a second pos clitic, it is not a bound morpheme.) I think that the reduced 2sg aux may be retained in a ""minimal answer"" (bit unsure what that is).

Gloss: {neg} Petr {neg}-publish.3sg {neg} articles {neg} Translation: Peter doesn't publish articles. Comment: The example shows that in the SOV order, the negation comes between the subject and the verb (and only there). One reason to classify it as a prefix (as opposed to a particle) is that it obligatorily moves with the verb (the host of the prefix): Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: Petr {*ne} články {ne}-píše Gloss: Petr neg articles neg-writes Translation: Petr doesn't write articles. Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: A: Píše Petr články? B: Ne Gloss: A: writes Petr articles? B: Neg Translation: A: Does Peter write articles? B: No Comment: However, this example shows that a morpheme homophonous to the negative prefix ""ne"" can occur on its own in short replies. This is impossible for aspectual verbal prefixes (and is an unexpected behavior of an affix in general, or at least according to the definition given.) Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: br-á-t či ne-br-a-t? (*ne-br-á-t) Gloss: take-th-inf or neg-take-th-inf vs. neg-take-th-inf Translation: to take or not to take? Comment: This example shows that the negation has an influence on the length of the thematic vowel (glossed TH): long vowel (á) without the negation, short vowel (a) with the negation. This speaks in favor of its prefixal status. This is because the thematic vowel ""a"" is ""regularly"" short, and lengthens only with roots that have no vowel (plausibly to produce a bi-moraic ""minimal word""). The fact that the ""a"" is short in the negated infinitive shows that the negation counts as a part of the ""prosodic word.""

Comment: For reasons related to the property Num-Dem-N, let me mention that the example is fine in the following context: suppose four ships arrive to a harbour, but find all the docking places occupied. So, ""the four ships had to leave the harbour."" (This rules out partitive interpretation.) Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: Co si myslíš o těchhle čtyrech knížkách?

Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: Čtyry ty lodě musely z přístavu odplout. Gloss: four the ships had_to from harbour leave. Translation: Four of the ships had to leave the harbour. Comment: The same word order as in the preceding example is grammatical in a context where five ships arrive at a harbour.

Comment: In comparison to the declarative in 05_svo, this sentence has a raising intonation at the end (typical for Cz questions). However, it does not front the verb (compare the example in Q_01). The meaning is dependent on further factors. If the main stress falls on ""soup"", and the raising intonation starts there, the meaning is surprise. With stress on the verb, one meaning is: does he eat it or drink it? Another one: does also Peter eat soup? Value set to NO, as these are not ""neutral.""

Each seems to have slightly different properties (e.g. 1st sg can be left out when the subject is overt, 2sg cannot). The 2sg aux can be reduced to a single consonant, other auxiliaries cannot. (Even when reduced, it is a second pos clitic, it is not a bound morpheme.) I think that the reduced 2sg aux may be retained in a ""minimal answer"" (bit unsure what that is).

Gloss: {neg} Petr {neg}-publish.3sg {neg} articles {neg} Translation: Peter doesn't publish articles. Comment: The example shows that in the SOV order, the negation comes between the subject and the verb (and only there). One reason to classify it as a prefix (as opposed to a particle) is that it obligatorily moves with the verb (the host of the prefix): Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: Petr {*ne} články {ne}-píše Gloss: Petr neg articles neg-writes Translation: Petr doesn't write articles. Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: A: Píše Petr články? B: Ne Gloss: A: writes Petr articles? B: Neg Translation: A: Does Peter write articles? B: No Comment: However, this example shows that a morpheme homophonous to the negative prefix ""ne"" can occur on its own in short replies. This is impossible for aspectual verbal prefixes (and is an unexpected behavior of an affix in general, or at least according to the definition given.) Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: br-á-t či ne-br-a-t? (*ne-br-á-t) Gloss: take-th-inf or neg-take-th-inf vs. neg-take-th-inf Translation: to take or not to take? Comment: This example shows that the negation has an influence on the length of the thematic vowel (glossed TH): long vowel (á) without the negation, short vowel (a) with the negation. This speaks in favor of its prefixal status. This is because the thematic vowel ""a"" is ""regularly"" short, and lengthens only with roots that have no vowel (plausibly to produce a bi-moraic ""minimal word""). The fact that the ""a"" is short in the negated infinitive shows that the negation counts as a part of the ""prosodic word.""

Comment: In comparison to the declarative in 05_svo, this sentence has a raising intonation at the end (typical for Cz questions). However, it does not front the verb (compare the example in Q_01). The meaning is dependent on further factors. If the main stress falls on ""soup"", and the raising intonation starts there, the meaning is surprise. With stress on the verb, one meaning is: does he eat it or drink it? Another one: does also Peter eat soup? Value set to NO, as these are not ""neutral.""

Comment: Set against the first example, the sentence shows that only the aux moves. However, note that this is specific to the future aux `will.' Past tense aux is distinct: Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: Vy jste psali dopis Gloss: you.pl aux=be.2.pl written letter Translation: You were writing the latter Comment: a base line for the next ex: Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: *jste vy psali dopis? Gloss: are you.pl written letter? Translation: Were we writing the letter Comment: shows that the past aux cannot front.

Each seems to have slightly different properties (e.g. 1st sg can be left out when the subject is overt, 2sg cannot). The 2sg aux can be reduced to a single consonant, other auxiliaries cannot. (Even when reduced, it is a second pos clitic, it is not a bound morpheme.) I think that the reduced 2sg aux may be retained in a ""minimal answer"" (bit unsure what that is).

Gloss: {neg} Petr {neg}-publish.3sg {neg} articles {neg} Translation: Peter doesn't publish articles. Comment: The example shows that in the SOV order, the negation comes between the subject and the verb (and only there). One reason to classify it as a prefix (as opposed to a particle) is that it obligatorily moves with the verb (the host of the prefix): Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: Petr {*ne} články {ne}-píše Gloss: Petr neg articles neg-writes Translation: Petr doesn't write articles. Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: A: Píše Petr články? B: Ne Gloss: A: writes Petr articles? B: Neg Translation: A: Does Peter write articles? B: No Comment: However, this example shows that a morpheme homophonous to the negative prefix ""ne"" can occur on its own in short replies. This is impossible for aspectual verbal prefixes (and is an unexpected behavior of an affix in general, or at least according to the definition given.) Contributor: Pavel Caha Words: br-á-t či ne-br-a-t? (*ne-br-á-t) Gloss: take-th-inf or neg-take-th-inf vs. neg-take-th-inf Translation: to take or not to take? Comment: This example shows that the negation has an influence on the length of the thematic vowel (glossed TH): long vowel (á) without the negation, short vowel (a) with the negation. This speaks in favor of its prefixal status. This is because the thematic vowel ""a"" is ""regularly"" short, and lengthens only with roots that have no vowel (plausibly to produce a bi-moraic ""minimal word""). The fact that the ""a"" is short in the negated infinitive shows that the negation counts as a part of the ""prosodic word.""

Polar questions always involve V- or Aux-fronting and special intonation. The SV order in the example is grammatical as a polar question. However, it involves a left dislocated nominative subject, so it cannot be taken as an instance of a neutral polar question with SV order. Left dislocation is detected by special contrastive topic intonation on the subject. The rest of the clause exhibits the usual polar question intonation.

Comment: The corresponding declarative sentence is allowed with both SV and VS order. The example involves either no fronting, or string-vacuous movement of the verb or movement across S.

However, it involves a left dislocated nominative subject, so it cannot be taken as an instance of a neutral polar question with SV order.

Polar questions always involve V- or Aux-fronting and special intonation. The SV order in the example is grammatical as a polar question. However, it involves a left dislocated nominative subject, so it cannot be taken as an instance of a neutral polar question with SV order.

Comment: The corresponding declarative sentence is allowed with both SV and VS order. The example involves either no fronting, or string-vacuous movement of the verb or movement across S.

Comment: The corresponding declarative sentence is allowed with both SV and VS order. The example involves either no fronting, or string-vacuous movement of the verb or movement across S.
